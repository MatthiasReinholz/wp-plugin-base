# Contributing

This file is managed by `wp-plugin-base`. Update it from the foundation repo instead of hand-editing it here.

## Branching Model

This repository uses short-lived branches:

- `main`: protected and intended to stay releasable
- `feature/<topic>`: normal development work
- `release/<version>`: release preparation only
- `hotfix/<version>`: urgent production fixes branched from `main`

Do not push directly to `main`. Open a pull request instead.

## Release Process

Releases are tag-driven. A branch push must never publish a plugin release.

Normal release flow:

1. Merge the intended feature branches into `main`.
2. Run the `prepare-release` workflow and choose `patch`, `minor`, `major`, or `custom`.
3. Review the generated `release/x.y.z` pull request.
4. Review the auto-generated changelog entry, adjust it if needed, and complete any plugin-specific smoke tests.
5. Merge the `release/x.y.z` pull request into `main`.
6. The merged release PR automatically creates and pushes the `x.y.z` tag.
7. The pushed tag automatically triggers the publish workflow.

Hotfixes use the same model from `hotfix/x.y.z` branches.

## CI And Release Automation

This project uses local managed workflow files generated from `wp-plugin-base` version `__FOUNDATION_VERSION__`.

Managed workflow files:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `.github/workflows/prepare-release.yml`
- `.github/workflows/finalize-release.yml`
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- `.github/workflows/update-foundation.yml`

The WordPress.org deploy path is built in but opt-in. It only runs when `WP_ORG_DEPLOY_ENABLED=true`.

Set `WP_ORG_DEPLOY_ENABLED` in GitHub Actions settings as either:

- a repository variable for the whole repository, or
- an environment variable on the deployment environment used by the release workflow
